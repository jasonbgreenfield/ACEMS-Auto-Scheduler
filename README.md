# Auto-Scheduling-Project

Run​: To run the file, download the .zip file and compile all files in it. Run the CalGraph.java file only. This file calls all other files and takes in the user input and prints the calendar graphic output. 

Use​: To use our program, you will run CalGraph.java and put in a number of user inputs.
Firstly, these inputs set the start and end dates for the schedule. Additionally, the user inputs
the name of the .csv file that will be read. The user will also input the names for people that will
be prioritized for busy shifts. Our program reads a specifically styled .csv file that is generated from a
google form that we created:

The .csv is the spreadsheet of results from this form:

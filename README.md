# Auto-Scheduling-Project
Software automatically schedules shifts for ACEMS. Program reads the multiple-choice scheduling survey and sorts the responses according to rank and shift availability. Algorithm takes into account shift frequency and member prioritization for specific shifts. Program prints the finished schedule on a calendar graphic. 

The user inputs the start and end dates for the schedule and may flag member's that the sorting algorithm will weight to put on Friday and Saturday night shifts, which is important to ACEMS. The inputed .csv files are generated from this google form (https://goo.gl/forms/XgPa4OC38Ov2Daxg1) which is administered to ACEMS personnel.

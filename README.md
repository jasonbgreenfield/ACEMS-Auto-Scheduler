# CS-Logistics-Project

Compile​: To compile our program, simply compile all the files in our .zip folder 

Run​: To run the file, you will run the CalGraph.java file only (java CalGraph). This file calls all
the other files and takes the user input and prints the calendar graphic output. You will have to
input a few values for the start/end dates in addition to the name of the .csv file for the schedule

Use​: To use our program, you will run CalGraph.java and put in a number of user inputs.
Firstly, these inputs set the start and end dates for the schedule. Additionally, the user inputs
the name of the .csv file that will be read. The user will also input the names for people that will
be prioritized for busy shifts (Note: the input name has to match exactly with the name of the
member in the .csv file).Our program reads a specifically styled .csv file that is generated from a
google form that we created:

The .csv is the spreadsheet of results from this form:
